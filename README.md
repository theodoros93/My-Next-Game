The application we created is called My Next Game which suggests video games on various platforms to the user, according to his preferences. 
The application was implemented with the Android Studio tool and concerns exclusively android devices with Android 8 (Oreo) and beyond. 
We also used the RAWG API where we call the games that appear in the application according to the user's preferences. 
Application is for users who are gamers and want to explore the gaming market depending on what they like and the platform they have. 
What characterizes the innovation of the application is that after research in the Play Store there is no corresponding application that will look for games with various features that the user desires in addition to the platform where the game is played.
When entering the application, the user sees three options, Discover, Library and Wishlist. 
In the library he can store the games he has in his possession and in the Wishlist the games he wants to acquire in the future. 
With the discover option the user is transferred to another screen where he is asked to enter the name of the game if he wants something specific, the category / categories of game he wants, some tags e.g. RPG, Co-op etc., as well as the platform he owns. 
Then it shows all the games that contain the features that the user has set and can enter a game to see its features, description, ratings, etc. 
Finally the user can add a game to his library or Wishlist of.
